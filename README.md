# Technical Overview of Dataflow with AWS Airflow and Kinesis Services â€“

 We are going to build the airflow data pipeline orchestration from scratch in this project. Initially, we need AWS and GitHub account before starting this project so make sure having those from yourself.

 We are going to fork GitHub repository from another GitHub account. After than setting up AWS Code Pipeline Service to automatically sync(CI/CD) between GitHub repository source code and AWS S3 storage service.
